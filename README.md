# ServerlessTodosPlusUI

This project evolves original [ServerlessTodos](https://github.com/nerdguru/serverlessTodos), which added Mocha tests to the [Serverless Framework Todo example](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-rest-api-with-dynamodb) and plugged them into AWS CodePipeline to now use [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to provide a serverless front end.  The idea for this was inspired by [Scope](https://github.com/serverless/scope).

## Setup
TBD
